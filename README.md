At the time of writing this README I am working on a project.
It is about socket programming in Java.

Most of the times my machine has to run the servers and my team have to connect to my machine.

The problem I have, however is ...

Sometimes my team can't connect to my machine though we are on the same network.
What I have realized is that almost everyday my local IP address changes.
Now I have to go to the terminal and check my local IP everyday and push it to our repo.

They have to, including me, go to the repo and copy this new IP everyday.

I am working on writing a script that automates this process.
